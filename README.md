# 100 Days of Machine Learning

This repository contains my daily progress in learning Machine Learning, inspired by the [CampusX YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/@CampusX). 

Each day, I will create a separate folder with code, explanations, and Jupyter notebooks (where needed) to document what I’ve learned.

## 📌 Goals

- Learn ML theory and practical implementation
- Explore key tools like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.
- Document everything clearly and consistently
- Build a strong foundation in ML

Stay tuned for updates every day!
