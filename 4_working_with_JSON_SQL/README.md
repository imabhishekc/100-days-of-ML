# ðŸ“… Day 4: Working with JSON & SQL using Pandas | 100 Days of Machine Learning

Welcome to **Day 4** of my **#100DaysOfML** journey.  
Today, I explored how to **handle JSON data** and how to **query SQL databases using Pandas**.  
These skills are vital when dealing with real-world datasets coming from APIs, NoSQL/JSON-based sources, or traditional relational databases.

---

## What You Will Learn

- Load structured and nested data from `.json` files or public JSON APIs
- Connect Python with MySQL databases using both `mysql-connector` and `SQLAlchemy`
- Use Pandas to run SQL queries and retrieve clean DataFrames
- Handle SQL driver warnings and adopt best practices for production use

---

## Requirements

Install these packages before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas requests mysql-connector-python SQLAlchemy
